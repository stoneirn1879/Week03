		 * 1.	Create an array of int called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
			a.	Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element 
			of the array (do not type ANY numbers in the operation, ages[7] – ages[0] is not allowed). Print the result to the console.
			b.	Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).
			c.	Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age. Print the result to the console.
